Blocking Transformations

The simplest version of this is an aggregate transformation because an aggregate must process every row in the transformation before it produces a total or in the case of a SORT, it must go through every record before it finishes.

These include:

Aggregate
Fuzzy Grouping
Fuzzy Lookup
Row Sampling
Sort
Term Extraction
Script Component – When configured to receive all rows..
Semi-Blocking Transformations

These partially hold up a transformation for processing and they don’t need to read the entire data set before processing.  However, something usually has to happen to the record before it can move on.  For instance, it’s part of a Join, and it needs to process it’s part of the join before it can move on.

These include:

Data Mining Query
Merge
Merge Join
Pivot
Term Lookup
Unpivot
Union All
Non-Blocking Transformations

Here, no blocking takes place.  The row is process, and then it moves to the next step.

These include:

Audit
Cache Transform
Character Map
Conditional Split
Copy Column
Data Conversion
Derived Column
DQS Cleansing
Export Column
Lookup
Multicast
OLE DB Command
Percent Sampling
Row Count
Script Component – Except when configured for all.

Finally, transformations are processed asynchronously or synchronously.  Non-blocking transformations are synchronous, while blocking and semi-blocking are asynchronous.
